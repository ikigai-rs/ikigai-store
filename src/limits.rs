//! Bounds on caller-supplied SPARQL, checked before the parser sees a byte (ledger #915).
//!
//! oxigraph's SPARQL parser (`spargebra`, a `peg` grammar) and its evaluator (`sparopt`,
//! `spareval`) are **recursive**, so a query's shape is a claim on the stack of whatever
//! thread parses it. Running out is not an error a caller gets back: Rust aborts the
//! **whole process** on a stack overflow, on any thread. `SELECT * WHERE { FILTER(((…1…))) }`
//! with ~1000 parentheses took down a host through its HTTP door, and the anonymous grant
//! held the read authority that reached the parse.
//!
//! Two layers, because neither is enough alone:
//!
//! 1. **[`check_sparql`] refuses, never truncates.** A query or update over
//!    [`MAX_SPARQL_BYTES`], or that nests deeper than [`MAX_SPARQL_NESTING`] — brackets,
//!    and runs of the one prefix operator spargebra recurses on, `!` — is refused with a
//!    typed `InvalidArgument` naming the bound, before anything is parsed. Those are the
//!    cheapest ways to recurse (ONE byte a level; ~2.3 KiB of stack a level for a bracket
//!    in a release build), so this is the check that turns a 3 KB query that killed a host
//!    into a refusal.
//! 2. **[`on_sparql_stack`] runs the parse AND the evaluation on a thread whose stack is
//!    sized from the query's length.** Nesting is not the only recursion: measured on a
//!    2 MiB thread in a release build, 1,879 triple patterns, 2,087 `FILTER`s, a 2,086-way
//!    `||` or 3,283 `+` terms all overflow — and those are shapes a generated query can
//!    legitimately have, so no lexical bound can refuse them without refusing real work.
//!    What bounds them is the byte bound times the stack each byte can cost, and the thread
//!    is where that budget lives: [`STACK_PER_BYTE`] per byte above a [`STACK_BASE`] floor.
//!    A thread's stack is reserved address space, committed only as it is touched, so an
//!    ordinary query costs the spawn and nothing else.
//!
//! ★ **The thread is sized for the BUILD, so a debug and a release build admit and answer the
//! same queries** (ledger #1003). An unoptimized build spends up to ~70× the stack per level (a
//! 2 MiB thread holds 46 `+` terms when evaluating, against 3,282 in release), and through
//! 0.2.9 the release sizing applied to both: a debug host aborted on a `1*1*…` chain of ~405
//! terms, well inside [`crate::budget::MAX_ALGEBRA_NODES`]. [`sparql_stack_size`] adds, when
//! `debug_assertions` are on, [`DEBUG_STACK_PER_NODE`] for every node the algebra bound
//! admits and [`DEBUG_STACK_PER_BYTE`] in place of [`STACK_PER_BYTE`]; both are measured.
//! Sizing rather than a depth bound, because a bound low enough for a debug build would
//! refuse in release what release answers, and because an `IN` list — one algebra node
//! however long — recurses once a member, so no node count could bound it.
//! The bracket bound holds in both: a debug build at [`MAX_SPARQL_NESTING`] of the costliest
//! bracket (`STR(` calls, ~60 KiB a level) needs ~4 MiB, well inside [`STACK_BASE`].
//!
//! ⚠ **And on wasm there is no thread**: [`on_sparql_stack`] runs inline there, so only the
//! first layer applies, on whatever stack the host gave the module.
//!
//! ⚠ **Neither layer bounds TIME.** The evaluator is quadratic in an operator chain's
//! length: 40,000 `||1` terms (120 KB) take ~30 s of a core in a release build and 80,000
//! more than two minutes, and long property paths, long BGPs and deeply nested collections
//! are slow well before they are deep. This module is about the stack — an abort takes
//! down every request at once. Time is [`crate::budget`]'s (ledger #964): this crate's doors
//! run every evaluation within one, on a thread sized exactly as [`on_sparql_stack`] sizes
//! it.
//!
//! # The scan is exact about what it skips, and that took an automaton
//!
//! The obvious scan — count `(`, `{`, `[`, skipping strings, `<IRI>`s and `#` comments —
//! is **wrong in a way an attacker can use**, because SPARQL's lexing of `<` depends on
//! where the parser is: in a triple pattern `<…>` is an IRI, but in an expression `?a<…`
//! is a less-than. spargebra accepts `<` + anything-but-`>` + `>` as an IRI only where an
//! IRI is allowed and the text inside is a valid IRI; elsewhere it is an operator, and the
//! "IRI" is code. So `( ?a<'> ) ' && ( ?a<'> ) ' && (…` reads to a skip-the-IRI scan as one
//! level, while the parser sees `(?a < "> ) " && (?a < "> ) " && (…` — a string it opens
//! INSIDE what the scan skipped — and nests once per repetition. A `#` inside such a token
//! does the same with a comment.
//!
//! So the scan follows **every reading** the grammar allows, as a small set of branches, and
//! refuses on the deepest. At a `<` it forks: an IRI (when the text up to the next `>` could
//! be one), a `<<` triple-term opener (when one follows), and a less-than — the last only
//! when the innermost open bracket is `(`, because every SPARQL expression sits directly
//! inside parentheses, so that is the only place a less-than can occur. Branches in the
//! same lexical state with the same open brackets are merged, so an ordinary query runs as
//! one branch and the whole scan stays linear. A closer pops only the opener it matches, so
//! no reading can be made to look shallower than it is; and a query that keeps more than
//! [`MAX_SCAN_BRANCHES`] readings alive at once is refused as too ambiguous to bound.
//!
//! ⚠ One more reading lives OUTSIDE the grammar: spargebra's `standard-unicode-escaping`
//! feature rewrites `\uXXXX` and `\UXXXXXXXX` anywhere in the text **before** tokenizing,
//! so `\u0028` is a `(`. oxigraph does not enable it, but feature unification is global and
//! a sibling could; when the text contains such an escape, the scan also runs over the
//! unescaped text and refuses on either.
